This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Reading in data

Before beginning the analysis, let's get the data into R. Assuming R is installed on your computer, the first thing we want to do is create a workspace. 

The first objective is to convert the ascii community data file to an R object. 

```{r tidy=TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
# raw_data_file <- 'data/raw/1992-01-01/bryceveg.R' # relative to where the project .Rproj file is!
raw_data_file <- '../data/raw/1992-01-01/bryceveg.R' # relative to where the .Rmd file is!
veg <- read.table(raw_data_file,header=TRUE,row.names=1)
```

```{r tidy=TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
test_raw_data_file <- '/organisation/data/raw/1992-01-01/bryceveg.R' # absolute path based on where the project .Rproj file is!

test_veg <- read.table(raw_data_file,header=TRUE,row.names=1)
```

# Data set characteristics
Now that we've got the data into a data frame, we can examine the characteristics of the distribution of the data. First, we need to know there are 160 plots and 169 species in the data set. R could tell us that if we asked:

```{r tidy=TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
dim(veg)          # to get the dimensions of the data set
names(veg)        # to get the columns names (species in our case)
row.names(veg)    # to get the row names (plots in our case)
```
